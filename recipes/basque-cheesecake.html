        <h3>Description</h3>
            <p>So Basque cheesecake is basically burnt cheesecake...
                No really. This recipe comes from the restaurant in Spain that goes by the name of La Viña. 
                Really it’s an adapted iteration of their recipe that I found online. 
                I don’t know if I saw their actual recipe, but hey, it’s pretty darn close. 
                The best part is that it’s so incredibly easy and quick to make unlike most cheesecakes.

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>678g cream cheese</li>
                <li>226g mascarpone</li>
                <li>320g sugar</li>
                <li>6 eggs</li>
                <li>1 egg yolk</li>
                <li>4g fine sea salt</li>
                <li>415mL heavy cream</li>
                <li>7g vanilla extract</li>
                <li>9g orange blossom water</li>
                <li>52g all purpose flour</li>
            </ul>
        
        <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Start by buttering up a 9” cake pan and press in a sheet of parchment paper. Once the first sheet is pressed in tightly, add another sheet of parchment. </li>
                <li>To a stand mixing bowl, add the cream cheese and mascarpone then mix on low speed.</li>
                <li>Once the mixture is smooth, gradually add in granulated sugar while mixing. Increase speed to medium when almost all the sugar has been added.</li>
                <li>Mix and scrape down the sides until smooth. </li>
                <li>On medium speed, add in eggs one at a time and once all the eggs are added add in the egg yolk. </li>
                <li>Once incorporated, add in sea salt, heavy cream, vanilla extract and orange blossom water. Mix until smooth. </li>
                <li>Sift in all-purpose flour. Mix on medium speed until combined.</li>
                <li>Pour cheesecake batter directly into the cake pan. </li>
                <li>Place the pan onto a baking sheet and into a 400F for 60 minutes.</li>
                <li>Let cool at room temperature while still in the pan. </li>
                <li>Remove cake pan once the cake has fallen a bit and let the cake cool all the way to room temperature before removing the parchment paper.</li>
                <li>Serve at room temperature.</li>
            </ol>
